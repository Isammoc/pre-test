# Walkthrough

Here is my personal space to explain what I made, what I plan, what I want.

## 1. Taking ownership

First thing first, when a project starts or when a project is given to my team,
I like to see the project following the team convention. As for this project I will
be alone, I will chose my personal taste in this subject.

 * A `README.md` with minimum sections
 * `pom.xml` with the java version

**Next step**: looking at the code and automate test launching.
